                        <string name="wls_tutorial_text_two">Make sure your are in a safe location on flat ground and
have plenty of space around you. Hold your phone at arms length, and turn your entire body
in the direction of the arrow. When it points up, tilt your arm up into the sky. When you
reach the star, the circle will expand, and the screen will freeze.

                        <string name="wls_tutorial_text_three">Now tell us if you can see the star or not. If most of
the sky is blocked by trees or buildings, you may need to try using the app in another
location. If the app is not working properly, we would really like to hear from you! Please
send a message to christopher.kyba@wew.fu-berlin.de
